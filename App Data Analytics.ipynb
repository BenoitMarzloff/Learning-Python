    "More than half (58%) of the IOS apps are `Games`. It is far more popular than its runner-up, the `Entertainment` category (7.88%).\n",
    "\n",
    "A trend that can be noticed is that application genres covered by the default apps are much more likely to not be as popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, games are not installed by default on your Apple device when you buy it. But there is a default camera app, that makes most `Photo & Video` apps quasi-useless. Which is surprising in a way since Apple handheld devices, mainly Iphones, are most probably the most popular photo taking device in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another trend that is noticeable is that there exists two types of apps. Those that we only need to install once and those that we use a bit then delete to then install another similar app.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example Facebook, part of the `Social Networking` genre, only needs to be installed once and has few reasons to be uninstalled (and re-downloaded). On the other hand, a racing game might be uninstalled when it is finished, and the user will replace it with another racing game. An app that shows only one movie will be cycled (installed and un-installed) rather quickly compared to an app that shows many movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is what most propably causes the overwhelming majority of `Games` apps. **Instead of 1 gaming app that gives access to 20 games, we get 20 single gaming apps. This sort of meta is hard to replicate for other types of apps.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, leisure-based apps `Games`, `Entertainment`, `Social Networking`, `Sports`, `Music`, `Lifestyle` represent roughly 75% of all IOS apps! If the company's strategy is to focus on making low initial quality types of apps, they can focus on these single-use biased genre of apps.\n",

    "It can be seen that the `Games` genre is much less popular on Android than on IOS, this is due to 2 mains reasons:\n",
    " 1. Android features a much more customizable experience, thus driving the popularity of non-game apps much higher compared to Apple's ecosystem. Consumers can express their individuality more easily than on IOS. \n",
    " 2. They simply categorize their apps differently. For example `Family` apps are sometimes clearly games. Examples include `Red Embrace (BL/Yaoi Game)`, `Beauty Rental Shop`, `City Builder 2016: County Mall`... Thus their categorizations lead to a perceived underrepresentation of their presence.\n",

    "For the `ios_master` list we unfortunately do not have this index. This is why we'll use `Rating_count` as a proxy. It is at index 5. \n"
