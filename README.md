# Learning-Python
A repo full of my python beginner programs!

FirstOne = first programs, very basic functions used such as len, print
KnockKnock = define my own function, and mess about with converting given text to lower/upper cases
ForbiddenMove = handling errors in a user made function when dividing for 0, or inputting non intergers
