# Learning-Python
A repo full of my python beginner programs!

## **Advanced Projects:**

App Data Analytics: finding profitable app profiles

## **Beginner programs:**

FirstOne = first programs, very basic functions used such as len, print

KnockKnock = define my own function, and mess about with converting given text to lower/upper cases

ForbiddenMove = handling errors in a user made function when dividing for 0, or inputting non intergers

Premier League = Ranking number, position and name of the Premier League teams. Program asks which team is in X ranking and how much points they have. Then it creates a new list to be able to tell the list of teams above it in the rankings thanks to a for loop and the append command.
